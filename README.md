  # Star2D
  Star2D is a game engine developed for Android.

  Hello everyone, very busy nowadays, but I like this project very much ðŸ’•. Thanks to everyone supporting me while developing it.

  **Why is Star2D special?**  
  Star2D is a very simple engine, made by a simple developer, with simple tools, and 0 benefits.  
  My goal with this project is to create a game engine that works well on mobile devices, with an interactive UI/UX and smooth gameplay.

  After working several months on this project, I've implemented many features like the **CodeGenerator**, which generates clear code (still needs improvement) instead of just random stuff.

  I'm interested in developing game engines, but unfortunately, I lack time and experience. Star2D is missing some core logic! I know I should use OpenGL or at least LibGDX to make it work on other platforms, but it's hard when working alone.

  *Please help me update this engine and contribute! Even simple work is appreciated.*
